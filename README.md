# Env Wrangler

![Coverage](https://img.shields.io/badge/coverage-97%25-brightgreen)

## Overview

Extract secrets from .env files into their own file (either `.secrets` or `secrets.json`). Also provides `mask` and `unmask` options. The resulting secrets file can be leveraged to get your secrets into a 3rd party secrets manager like AWS Secrets Manager or something else.

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install env-wrangler
```

## Usage
The `path` parameter is a directory, not a file!

```bash
env-wrangler extract --path=".envs/.production"
# Only run if you've previously run extract
env-wrangler mask --path=".envs/.production"
env-wrangler unmask --path=".envs/.production"
```

> **NOTE:** For help run `env-wrangler --help` or for a specific command run `env-wrangler {command} --help`.

Upon first run, `env-wrangler` creates a `~/.env-wrangler/env-wrangler.cfg` file. You can modify this to add/remove key words based on your needs.

```ini
[default]
; Any environment variable that contains one of the following key words will be considered a secret
key_words = ACCESS_KEY, ACCESS_TOKEN, API_KEY, CLIENT_ID, CLIENT_SECRET, CONSUMER_KEY, CREDENTIALS, ENCRYPTION_KEY, HASH, JWT_SECRET, MASTER_KEY, OAUTH_TOKEN, PASSWORD, PRIVATE_KEY, SALT, SECRET, TOKEN, USER
; The env files that will be considered for extraction
envs = .env, .django, .postgres
```

## Development

```bash
make env
make pip_install
make pip_install_editable
```

## Testing

```bash
make pytest
make coverage
make open_coverage
```

# TODO
- Add tests for cli commands
